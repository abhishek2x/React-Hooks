> ## Hooks

Hooks is a new feature in React 16.8 which allows you to use React features without having to write a class.

### **Why Hooks?**

Problem-1

- Understanding how this keyword works in JavaScript
- Remember to bind event handlers in class Components
- Classes don't minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable.

Problem-2

- There is no perticular way to reuse stateful compomnent Logic
- HOC and render prop pattern do address this problem but it makes the code harder to follow.
- There is need to share stateful logic in a better way

Problem-3

- When creating component for complex scenarios, the related code is not organised in one place

### **Rules of Hooks**

- **Only call hooks at the top level**. Don't call hooks inside loop, conditions or nested functions.
- **Only call hooks from React functions**. Don't call hooks inside any regular JavaScript function.
